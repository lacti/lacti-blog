# Lacti's Archive

A source of [My blog](https://lacti.github.io/) that is powered by [`Gatsby.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) + [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) + [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [`Markdown`](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## Things I do

- Start a blog from [`gatsby-starter-typescript-plus`](https://github.com/resir014/gatsby-starter-typescript-plus).
- Add a [tag template](src/templates/tag.tsx).
- Fix some layouts for me :)
- Copy [contents](src/content/) from previous blog.
- Chain [`GitHub Actions`](https://github.com/lacti/lacti-blog/blob/master/.github/workflows/update.yml) to upload results by `gh-pages`.

## Old days

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build my own blog because it is so used widely and it is supported by GitHub as default. But after the time has gone that I installed that template I cannot remember any syntax and features of Jekyll and ruby so I cannot fix it anymore.

`Gatsby.js` is not simple that Jekyll I think but it is more friendly for me and can do more general things to generate pages with React and static site generator.
